                    <p data-testid="test-about-goals"> <strong>My goals:</strong> My goal for the HNG internship program
                        is to gain
                        hands-on experience in building real-world applications
                        while strengthening my skills in both frontend development. I aim to collaborate
                        with experienced
                        developers, learn modern tools and best practices, and improve my problem-solving and debugging
                        abilities. Through
                        mentorship, teamwork, and active participation in live projects, I hope to enhance my technical

                    <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
                    <p data-testid="test-about-confidence"><strong>My areas of low confidence:</strong> are mainly in
                        advanced frontend
                        development and website deployment. I sometimes find it
                        challenging to handle complex frontend structures, optimize user interfaces for performance, and
                        properly upload or
                        configure new sites on hosting platforms. However, Iwish learn and practice these
                        skills to build more
                        confidence and improve my ability to manage complete frontend projects from development to
                        deployment.
